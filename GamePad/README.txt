The code found here provides both an interface for the use of dual stick game pads in Unity and a convenient method of setting up axis data in Unity's input manager.

As is, this material can be used to set up under OSX with: 

- PS3 dual shock control, using stock drivers
- Xbox control, using the driver implemented by Tattie Bogle (http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver)

On windows, one may use:

- Xbox control, using stock drivers.

Both platforms support:

- WASD input, using Input Manager standard axes: right stick is mapped to the mouse and action buttons mapped to Fire1,Fire2,Fire3 and Jump

It would not be difficult to extend this to other controllers and systems, provided an adequate set of drivers.

A simple piece of test code is provided to verify input data.
